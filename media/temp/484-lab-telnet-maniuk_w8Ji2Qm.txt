Response status is 200 i.e. "Successful HTTP request"

There is no Set-Cookie in the response, probably because the website recognized the telnet client and knows that there is no point in trying to set the cookies.

Cookies is the way for the website to store information on the client side and later retrieve it.



If there is a typo in the HTTP version, then the server returns 403 which means that the server received and understood the request but refuses to proceed.
If the type is slight like "1" instead of "1.1" then the response is 200 but the server still closes connection.
